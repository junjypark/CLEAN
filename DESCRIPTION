Description: CLEAN is an R package for conducting spatial-extent inference for neuroimaging data that improves sensitivity by modelling spatial autocorrelation of the data followed by cluster enhancement. It currently supports CLEAN (for general linear model (GLM)), CLEAN-R (for testing intermodal correspondence), and CLEAN-V (for testing variance components in reliability and heritability studies).
